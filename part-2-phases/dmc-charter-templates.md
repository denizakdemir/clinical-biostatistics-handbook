#### DMC Recommendation Templates
```
DMC RECOMMENDATION CATEGORIES

1. CONTINUE AS PLANNED
"Based on review of available safety and efficacy data through [data cut-off date], 
the DMC recommends that the study continue as planned without modifications. 
The benefit-risk profile remains acceptable and supports continued enrollment."

Rationale: [2-3 sentences explaining key factors in decision]

2. CONTINUE WITH MODIFICATIONS  
"The DMC recommends continuation of the study with the following modifications:
- [Specific modification 1]
- [Specific modification 2]
- [Specific modification 3]

These modifications are recommended to [rationale for changes]."

Implementation timeline: [Specify when changes should be implemented]

3. TEMPORARY HOLD
"Based on [safety concern/data quality issue], the DMC recommends a temporary 
hold on enrollment while [specific actions] are completed. The DMC will reconvene 
in [timeframe] to reassess the situation."

Conditions for resumption:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]
- [Condition 3]

4. EARLY TERMINATION FOR EFFICACY
"Based on compelling evidence of efficacy with an acceptable safety profile, 
the DMC recommends early termination of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint 
has been met with statistical significance (p = [value]), and continued enrollment 
would be ethically inappropriate."

Supporting evidence: [Key statistical and clinical findings]

5. EARLY TERMINATION FOR FUTILITY
"Based on futility analysis showing conditional power of [X]% for the primary 
endpoint, the DMC recommends early termination of the study. Continuation is 
unlikely to demonstrate clinically meaningful benefit."

Statistical basis: [Conditional power calculation and assumptions]

6. EARLY TERMINATION FOR SAFETY
"Based on an unfavorable benefit-risk profile, the DMC recommends immediate 
study termination. The safety concerns outweigh any potential benefits."

Safety rationale: [Specific safety findings leading to recommendation]
