## Timeline Customization Notes

### Study-Specific Adjustments
- **Adaptive designs**: Add adaptation decision timepoints
- **Pediatric studies**: Include pediatric investigation plan milestones
- **Combination studies**: Add interaction assessment timepoints
- **Global submissions**: Stagger regional submission preparations

### Resource Planning
- **Statistical team sizing**: Plan for peak periods (interim analyses, database lock)
- **External consultants**: Engage regulatory statisticians as needed
- **Technology resources**: Ensure statistical software and infrastructure capacity

### Risk Mitigation
- **Buffer time**: Add 2-4 weeks buffer for critical milestones
- **Contingency planning**: Prepare for regulatory delays or additional requests
- **Communication protocols**: Establish clear escalation procedures
